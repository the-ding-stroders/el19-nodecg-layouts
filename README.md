# The Ding Stroders Extra Life 2020 Streamaganza NodeCG Bundle
tds-extralife-2020 is a [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle.
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `^1.6.0`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.

This bundle controlled the on-stream graphics for our community streams. It was created ***extremely*** quickly, so there's a lot of horrible code inside.

That being said, feel free to look around. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, contact [synth3tk](https://twitter.com/synth3tk) on Twitter.

## TODO:
* ~~The main plan, after catching our breath from the Extra Life streams, is to continue improving on this bundle to make it reusable for more frequent community streams.~~
* Write up a blog post (and maybe make videos) explaining some of the bundle.
* Maybe split out some of the more reusable stuff into their own separate bundles.
